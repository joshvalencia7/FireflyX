## Prototype

We created a prototype which will serve as our guide when creating _Grit_. The prototype will be revised overtime since we will be taking into account comments and suggestions of survey respondents and experts. A [download link](#) will be available once a working program is made.
 
### Initial Prototype (v0.0.1)
![MockUp1](/assets/img/mockup1.png)
This is the first prototype ( _See Figure above_ ) made before consulting comments and suggestions from survey respondents and experts. It can be observed that the current prototype is similar to _Github Desktop_ however, there are six features that we will be highlighting.

1. __Version-Control Module__ - Similar to GitHub desktop, _Grit_ will be able to execute git commands.
2. __Virtual Assistant__ - will serve as a guide for users in executing git commands and its function.  
3. __Command-Line with Predictive Text__ - will allow users to call git commands with predictive text. 
4. __Coachmarks__ - will enable first time users to navigate through the software easily by giving guides. 
5. __Practice with Codeblocks__ - will help user practice and understand the basic git commands.
6. __Coachmarks__ - An online mentoring tool that will allow novices to find a mentor. Since this is an online mentoring tool and will be in real time, this feature will only be accessible online.
